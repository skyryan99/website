How to Show off projects:

		- Picture relevant to project
		- Learning outcome maybe?
		- ***Button (maybe whole picture) that takes you to corresponding portion of the projects page***

	    + Have one long, scroll-down page with all projects
	    + Order them from most ---> least impressive or significant
