						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<p>
							Hello! My name is Schuyler Ryan and I am recently graduated Mechanical Engineer from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I concentrated in Mechatronics and minored in computer
							science. Since then, I have been working as an Electrical Engineer at 
							<a href="https://soeffects.com/">Second Order Effects</a>. I started in El Segundo, California, but now find myself in Redmond, Washington.
							<br>
							<br>							
							I am very interested in automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, aerospace, and electronics! I have been passionate about programming since taking my first computer
							science class at Cal Poly and have been passionate about Artificial Intelligence and
							space all my life. Completing Mechanical Engineering curriculum, I have found joy in working on the hardware side of computers, and have developed many hands on skills including performing bring-up testing, reworking hardware, and constructing test systems.
							I have also gained experience with project architecture, requirements generation, IV&V test planning, and technical leadership. I have primarily worked on the technical execution side of projects during my time at SOE.
							<br>
							<br>My goal with my career is to positively affect change in people’s lives. I am always looking for ways to contribute to novel technologies. I want to
							make things faster, cheaper, and safer to reach a greater number of people while
							minimizing our impact on the environment. I want to further humanity's reach into the
							cosmos, for exploration and settlement. My college Senior Design Project brought
							national attention to Cal Poly Engineering, as we have progressed to <strong>
								top 10 placement
								in NASA's RASC-AL Moon to Mars Ice and Prospecting Challenge
							</strong>, and won an award for our build. I led my team in
							developing a lightweight, durable, and hands-off method for extracting water from
							Martian/lunar subsurface ice layers while mapping soil density profiles. We brought our project to the competition site in Virginia in September 2021 and won the award for the most accurate digital core! Digital core is the name for the objective of mapping soil density profiles. My role on the
							project was been as Team Lead and Lead Software Developer. I was responsible for the digital core as well as automation of the entire system.
							<br>
							<br>I have experience working on various teams
							building remote controlled and autonomous robots, aerospace quality avionics, medical devices, and much more. I am familiar with machining and
							the manufacturing process as well as experience with programming in C, Python, MatLab,
							Java, assembly, and now HTML and JavaScript.
